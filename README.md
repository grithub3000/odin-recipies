My first ever full website. Also the first project from 'The Odin Project.'

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the HTML skills that I have aqquired over my short time in this course. It is a simple website with an index page that lists the name of several recipies, and also links to the full recipies with details on how to prepair the food.
